Software main purpouse:
-multithread scrap data (match statistics [and players statistics if they are avaliable], also players data (birth date, height, experience))
from https://www.flashscore.com/basketball/

Required imports:
-selenium
-bs4
-pandas
-numpy
-threading

Expected Input (nescessary):
    -League name
    -date period

Expected Input (optional):
    -no. of threads (default value set to optimal during tests)

Workflow:
    1.  Check if choosen League name is in avaliable Leagues, if so, go on. If not return BadEntry Exception with information of avaliable Leagues 
    2.  Scrap match list with internal flashscore id reference and hyperlinks, in selected data period. Write that data and compare if match with that
        flashscore id exist in DB, for further scraping use only that matches that not in DB.
    3.  Create FIFO stack with hyperlinks (with locking due to multithreding), match full date (date+time) and flashscore_match_id
    4.  Each thread:
            -popup match from stack and scrap data of:
                a) teams that play in that match
                b) match_statistic
                c) player_statistic
            -write data to pandas DF
            -based on flashscore_player_id for each player check if that player exist in DB, if not add that player to FIFO stack with players to scrap (common to all threads)
                if that player isn't already in that stack
    5. Every scraping action should be loged
    6. Script rather should handle errors and skip some matches (with clear summary in log) and keep scraping.
    7. At the end matches that cause error should be try once again.




DB_Creation:

DB name: Basketball_data

Tables:
-matches (id (PK), id_flashscore_match, league_ticker(FK->leagues), match_date, match_time, home_team_ticker(FK->teams), away_team_ticker(FK->teams), hyperlink,
            ht_q1_pts, at_q1_pts, ht_q2_pts, at_q2_pts, ht_q3_pts, at_Q3_pts, ht_q4_pts, at_q4_pts, ht_q5_pts, at_q5_pts,
            ht_odds_start, at_odds_start, ht_odds_end, at_odds_end)

-players_statistic (id (PK), id_match(FK->matches), id_flashscore_match(FK->matches), id_player(FK->players_info), name_short, team_ticker(FK->teams), pts, reb, ast, min, fgm, fga, 2pm, 2pa, 3pm, 3pa, ftm, fta, plus_minus,
                    or, dr, pf, st, to, bs, ba, tfs)

-players_info(id (PK), id_flashscore_player, full_name, birth_date, height, hyperlink)

-players_carrer(id (PK), id_player(FK->players_info), id_flashscore_player(FK->players_info), season_start_year, season_end_year, team_ticker(FK->teams), league_ticker(FK->leagues))

-teams(id (PK), league_full_name(FK->leagues), league_ticker(FK->leagues), team_name, team_ticker)

-leagues(id, league_ticker, league_full_name, league_hyperlink)*

*This is only table to fill in manually

(Using both flashscore id and internal to keep data consistency)
